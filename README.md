## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Aldara FernÃ¡ndez, a software engineering student at **42 Madrid** (FundaciÃ³n TelefÃ³nica), where Iâ€™m currently developing fascinating projects that are helping me expand my knowledge and skills in computer science.

ðŸ”­ My interests - I'm passionate about working on tech projects that strive to make a **positive social impact** â€” particularly in areas like culture, education, environmental sustainability, and public health. I enjoy not only building and maintaining software, but also engaging with people and understanding their needs through UX design.
  
ðŸŒ± Future goals - Continue growing as a **software developer** and deepen my knowledge in **artificial intelligence** and **data analysis**.

ðŸ‘¯ Programming with - C, Shell, Makefile. *Coming soon:* C++, Phyton.

ðŸ’» Tools - GitHub, Bash, Linux/Unix, Vim, VSC, VirtualBox. *Coming soon:* Docker, WordPress.

ðŸ¥° Human Languages - Spanish (native), English (C1), Italian (B2), basic levels of French and Portuguese.
